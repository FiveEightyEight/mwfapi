## Redis

### MacOS

Starting and stopping Redis using launchd
As an alternative to running Redis in the foreground, you can also use launchd to start the process in the background:

```
brew services start redis
```

This launches Redis and restarts it at login. You can check the status of a launchd managed Redis by running the following:

```
brew services info redis
````

If the service is running, you'll see output like the following:

```
redis (homebrew.mxcl.redis)
Running: ✔
Loaded: ✔
User: miranda
PID: 67975
```

To stop the service, run:

```
brew services stop redis
```
